								<p>One of the most precious things that one can have in their lives is companionship. Companionship in my opinion is one of the most underrated things a person can have, and when they finally find someone who's there through everything - there is nothing greater. So truly, Mashallah Raju I'm so happy and proud of you man. This right here is the best, and my personal favorite of you THAT I TOOK PERSONALLY (photographer gangg) with your other half. </p>

							<p>Honest to God, nothing beats your angry moments because they're probably the most memorable. In terms of all the moments that we've shared together, the ones thats hit the hardest are the ones where you're angry and you're trying to teach us all a lesson. I'm sure everyone in TheAbar *cough*cough*<strong>SHAMIM</strong>*cough*cough* appreciates all of your teaching moments. Those are the things that will last forever, and be forever ingrained into our memories of you. </p>

							<p>30 takes the cake for birthdays. It seems like a whole new experience and it's scary because you're embarking on a new journey on your life. You've entered another decade in your life, and we're entering 2020. </p>
							<p>Just remember, everyone here at TheAbrar appreciates all the hard work that you've done for us back then and now. We cherish the moments that we've shared with you, and no matter where in life we way go - You'll always be a part of us accumutively.

That mind of yours will stay juveline forever!! Ode love from me, and ode love from all of us at the Abrar. </p>
